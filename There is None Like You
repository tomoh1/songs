.G       D         Em
 There is none like You
.C     G                 Am             D
 No one else can touch my heart like You do
.G      D/F#           C        Cm       G
 I could search for all eternity Lord and find
.        D         G
 There is none like You

[C]
.    C     D            G     Em
 Your mercy flows like a river wide
.    C      D               G
 And healing comes from Your hands
.C        D            G            Em
 Suffering children are safe in Your arms
.C       Am        D 
 There is none like You</lyrics></song>
