[V1]
.G                            Bm
 I caught a glimpse of Your splendor
.        D     A     G
 In the corner of my eye
.                    Bm              A
 The most beautiful thing I've ever seen
.G                           Bm
 And it was like a flash of lightning
.D         A        G
 Reflected off the sky
.                 Bm           A    D
 And I know I'll never be the same

[C]
.D              Bm
 Show me Your glory
.G
 Send down Your presence
.                    A
 I want to see Your face
.D             Bm
 Show me Your glory
.G
 Majesty shines about You
.                            
 I can't go on without You, Lord

[V2]
 When I climb down the mountain
 And get back to my life
 I won't settle for ordinary things
 I'm gonna follow You forever
 And for all of my days
 I won't rest 'til I see You again</lyrics></song>
