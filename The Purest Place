.Dmaj7 G (4x)

[V1]
.G        A/C# G/C        Bm
 Paint me with Your purity
.G        A/C#   G/C         Bm
 That Id attract Your majesty
.G           A/C#  G/C           Bm
 When others boast in fame and gold
.     C              G/B
 The purest place is where Ill go

[C]
.           D  A/C#            Bm D/A
 The purest place I will draw near
.            G               C   G/B
 Do what it takes to keep me here
.        D  A/C#          Bm D/A
 In the center of Your heart
.            G   A           ( C  G/B to repeat )
 The purest place is where You are

[V2]
 Its not with masses, not with kings
 Not in these songs or offerings
 Not in this life or what it brings
 The purest place is You my King

[B]
.     Bm          A           G     D/F#
 If theres such thing as too beautiful
.     Bm          A           G     D/F#
 If theres such thing as too wonderful
.     Bm          A           G     D/F#
 If theres such thing as too marvelous
.C              G/B
 Jesus its You, Jesus its You</lyrics></song>
