.G                 Em               C                           Am
 Just the time I think that I’m at peace with the world that’s mine
.D              C                       G/B           C    D
 I feel at ease, I feel at home, and I know that I’m not alone||
.G                       Em                  C                     Am
 Then in my rest, there comes a test, that shakes me ‘til again I know
.D                 C                    G/B      C        D
 That what I’ve had is not enough and again I’ve got to grow

[C]
.G                       Em
 Oh, I want to know You more
.D                C                G
 Deep within my heart, I want to know You
.C               D
 Oh, I want to know You||
.    G                       Em
 And I would give my final breath
.     D               C              G
 To know You in Your death and resurrection
.C               D       Em
 Oh, I want to know You more
.C      D                G
 Oh, I want to know You more
 
[V2]
 The full supply I find as I move closer to the heart of God
 To strengthen me, to nourish me, and to fill my mind with Him||
 I’ve truly grown, but even so, my hunger hasn’t gone away
 Still I long, still I thirst, to know Him more each day</lyrics>
