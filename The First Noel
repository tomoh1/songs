  <lyrics>[V1]
 The first Noel the angel did say
 was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
 in fields where they lay keeping their sheep
 on a cold winter's night that was so deep.

[C1]
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
 born is the King of Israel

[V2]
 They looked up and saw a star
 shining in the east beyond them far;
 and to the earth it gave great light,
 and so it continued both day and night.

[V3]
 And by the light of that same star
 three Wise Men came from country far;
 to seek for a king was their intent
 and to follow the star wherever it went.

[V4]
 This star drew nigh to the northwest,
 o'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
 and there it did both stop and stay,
 right ovre the place where Jesus lay.</lyrics>
