.F#m                D
 Christ is my reward
.                A     Esus/G#
 And all of my devotion
.            F#m                  D
 Now there's nothing in this world
.                      A Esus/G#
 That could every satisfy

[P1]
.        A/C#      D    E            F#m
 Through every trial my soul will sing
.   A/C#       D       F#m         E
 No turning back, I've been set free

[C]
.A
 Christ is enough for me
.F#m                  E D
 Christ is enough for me

 Everything I need

.F#m                D
 Christ my all in all

 My joy and my salvation
.         F#m                D
 And this hope will never fail
.              A   Esus/G#
 Heaven is our home

[P2]
.        A/C#      D    E            F#m
 Through every storm my soul will sing
.  A/C#      D                F#m  E
 Jesus is here, to God be the glory
