.F#m     D            F#m          D  F#m
 You are all, Big and small, Beautiful
.          D                             F#m
 And wonderful To trust in grace through faith
.                  D
 But I'm asking to taste

.Bm                      A/C#
 For dark is light to You
.                          D
 The Depths are height to You
.                   E
 Far is near, But Lord I need to hear from You

[C]
.   A      A/G#
 Be near O God
.   A/F#   E
 Be near O God of us
.     D
 Your nearness
.      A/C#   E      ( F#m      D )
 Is to us our good...(our good )


[V2]
.F#m              D    F#m           D
 Your fullness is mine,   Revelation divine
.F#m         D                               F#m
 But oh to taste, To know much more than a page
.             D
 To feel Your embraceâ€¦

.Bm                      A/C#
 For dark is light to You
.                            D
 The Depths are height to You
.                    E
 Far is near, But Lord I need to hear from You
