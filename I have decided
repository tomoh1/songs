 Though I may wonder, still I will follow;
 Though I may wonder, still I will follow;
 Though I may wonder, still I will follow;
 No turning back, no turning back. 

[V4]
 The cross before me, the world behind me;
 The cross before me, the world behind me;
 The cross before me, the world behind me;
 No turning back, no turning back.
