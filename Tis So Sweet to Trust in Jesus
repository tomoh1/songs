.G       G/B        C       G/B
 ’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
.G        Em       Am      D
 Just to take Him at His Word;
.G       G/B    C        G
 Just to rest upon His promise,
.Em      Am          D         G
 And to know, “Thus saith the Lord!” 

[C]
.G        G/B   Am      D
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
.G          Em        Am       D
 How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er;
.G        G/B    C        G
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
.Em       Am        D        G
 .Oh, for grace to trust Him more!

[V2]
 Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus,
 Just to trust His cleansing blood;
 And in simple faith to plunge me
 ’Neath the healing, cleansing flood! 

[V3]
 Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
 Just from sin and self to cease;
 Just from Jesus simply taking
 Life and rest, and joy and peace. 

[V4]
 I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee,
 Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
 And I know that Thou art with me,
 Wilt be with me to the end. </lyrics>
