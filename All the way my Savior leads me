.E A/E

[V1]
.E                       A/E
 All the way my Savior leads me
.E                   A/E
 Who have I to ask beside
.F#m           E               B
 How could I doubt His tender mercy
.F#m           E               B
 Who through life has been my guide

[V2]
.E                       A/E
 All the way my Savior leads me
.E                          A/E
 Cheers each winding path I tread
.F#m        E               B
 Gives me grace for every trial
.F#m        E               B
 Feeds me with the living bread

[C]
.A        E/G#    B
 You lead me and keep me from falling
.A       E/G#    B
 You carry me close to Your heart
. F#m     E        B
 And surely Your goodness and mercy
.     F#m  E  B
 Will follow me

[V3]
.E                       A/E
 All the way my Savior leads me
.E                       A/E
 Oh, the fullness of His love
.F#m      E                B
 Oh, the sureness of His promise
.F#m      E              B
 In the triumph of His blood

[V4]
.E                            A/E
 And when my spirit clothed immortal
.C#m         B                  A
 Wings its flight to realms of day
.F#m       E                   B
 This my song through endless ages
.F#m    E              B
 Jesus led me all the way
.A                     B
 Jesus led me all the way
