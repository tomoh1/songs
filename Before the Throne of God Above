.C                    F/C   C
 Before the throne of God above,
.C                          Em
 I have a strong, a perfect plea,
.   C/E          F     C/E    G       Am
 A great High Priest whose name is Love,
.          F6         Dm7   F/G C
 Who ever lives and pleads for me.


[C1]
.             F C/E        G
 My name is graven on His hands,
.             F  C/E  F  G    Am
 My name is written on His heart;
.  Am/G        F   C/E   G       Am2
 I know that while in heav'n He stands
.Am Am/G        F             G  Am
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.
.   Am/G        F       G       C
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.

[V2]
 When Satan tempts me to despair,
 And tells me of the guilt within,
 Upward I look and see Him there
 Who made an end to all my sin.


[C2]
 Because the sinless Saviour died,
 My sinful soul is counted free;
 For God, the Just, is satisfied
 To look on him and pardon me.
 To look on him and pardon me.
---

[V3]
 Behold him there! the risen Lamb,
 My perfect, spotless Righteousness,
 The great unchangeable I AM,
 The King of glory and of grace!


[C3]
 One with Himself I cannot die,
 My soul is purchased by His blood;
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
 with Christ, my Saviour and my God
 with Christ, my Saviour and my God</lyrics>
