[V1]
.E                 A
 A refuge for the poor
.                     E
 A shelter from the storm
.             A
 This is our God
.E                        A
 He will wipe away your tears
.                         E
 And return your wasted years
.             A
 This is our God

[P1]
.          F#m
 So call upon his name
.       A
 He is mighty to save
.             E
 This is our God

[V2]
 Father to the orphan
 A healer to the broken
 This is our God
 He brings peace to our madness
 And comfort in our sadness
 This is our God

 A fountain for the thirsty
 A lover for the lonely
 This is our God
 He brings glory to the humble
 And crowns for the faithful
 This is our God
