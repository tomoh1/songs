.Bm                A/C#    D
 You call me out upon the waters
.           A                    G
 The great unknown where feet may fail.
.Bm                   A/C#    D
 And there I find You in the mystery
.         A                  G
 In oceans deep my faith will stand

[C]
.G           D            A
 And I will call upon Your name
.G           D             A
 And keep my eyes above the waves
.             G                 D               A
 When oceans rise my soul will rest in Your embrace
.          G         A       Bm  A/C# D    A   G
 For I am Yours and You are mine

[V2]
.Bm                     A/C#    D
 Your grace abounds in deepest waters
.              A               G
 Your sovereign hand will be my guide
.Bm                       A/C#    D
 Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
.            A                          G
 You've never failed and you won't start now

[B]
.Bm                        G
 Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
.        D                          A
 Let me walk up upon the waters wherever You would call me
.Bm                      G
 Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
.        D                                   A
 And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior
