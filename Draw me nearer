.C#m A B

[V1]
.       C#m      A
 I am thine, oh Lord 
.        B          E
 I have heard Your voice 
.        C#m       A      Bsus B
 And it told Your love to me 
.       C#m     A           B       E
 But I long to rise in the arms of faith 
.         C#m    A        E
 And be closer drawn to Thee 

[C]
.         C#m    A  E B
 Draw me nearer 
.         C#m        A         E/G#  B
 To the cross where Thou hast died 
.         C#m    A  E B
 Draw me nearer 
.         C#m        A      B
 To Your precious bleeding side 

[V2]
 There are great depths of love that I cannot know 
 'Til I cross that narrow sea 
 And there are heights of joy that I may not reach 
 Til I rest in peace with Thee

 You draw me with Your mercy 
.G#m
 You draw me with Your love 
.C#m                           A        B
 You draw me with forgiveness by Your blood 
.C#m
 You draw me with compassion 
.G#m
 You draw me as a bride 
.C#m                          A       B     B
 You draw me closer to Your precious side 

[V3]
 Consecrate me now to Your service, Lord 
 By the power of grace divine 
 Let me soul look up with a steadfast hope 
 And my will be lost in Thine
