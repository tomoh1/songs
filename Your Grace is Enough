.G              G/B             C
 Great is your faithfulness oh God
.Em           D                 C
 You wrestle with the sinnerâ€™s heart

 You lead us by still waters and to mercy
 And nothing can keep us apart

[P]

 So remember your people

 Remember your children

 Remember your promise oh God

 Your grace is enough

 Great is your love and justice God
 You use the weak to lead the strong
 You lead us in the song of your salvation
 And all your people sing along</lyrics>
