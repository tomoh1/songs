.A E
.Bm F#m D E

[V]
.     F#m                            D
 You thought of us before the world began to breathe
.     E/G#                            A A/G#
 You knew our names before we came to be
.     F#m                         D
 You saw the very day we'd fall away from you
.         E/G#                       A     A/G#
 And how desperately we need to be redeemed

[P]
.      D          E
 Lord Jesus come lead us
.       Bm                 E
 We're desperate for your touch

[C]
.A                       E
 Oh Great and Mighty One with one desire we come
.Bm      F#m         D                E
 That you would reign that you would reign in us
.A                           E
 We're offering up our lives a living sacrifice
.Bm      F#m         D                E         A
 That you would reign that you would reign in us

[V2]
 Spirit of the Living God fall fresh again
 Come search our hearts and purify our lives
 We need your perfect love
 We need your discipline
 We're lost unless you guide us with your light

[B]
.       E
 We cry out
.          D          A          E
 For your love to refine us cry out
.          D          A          E
 For your love to define us cry out
.          D        A        F#m                  E
 For your mercy to keep us blameless until you return


[T]
.    D            A       E
 So reign please reign in us
.      F#m        D         A         E
 Come purify our hearts we need your touch
.      F#m                D        A       E
 Come cleanse us like a flood and send us out
.        F#m                D         A       E
 So the world may know you reign you reign in us</lyrics></song>
