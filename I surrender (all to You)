.G                  D                        C2
 I'm giving You my heart, and all that is within
.              Em          D/F#            G
 I lay it all down for the sake of you my King
.G                   D                          C2
 I'm giving You my dreams, I'm laying down my rights
.                  Em            D/F#           G
 I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life

[C]
.    Em D/F#    G     C2      G   Em7     D   C2
 And   I    surrender all to You, all to You
.    Em D/F#    G     C2      G   Em7     D   C2
 And   I    surrender all to You, all to You

[V2]
 I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross 
 And all the world holds dear, I count it all as loss 
 For the sake of knowing You for the glory of Your name
 To know the lasting joy, even sharing in Your pain </lyrics></song>
