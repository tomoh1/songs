  <title>I'd Rather Have Jesus</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.     C           C7         F         C
 I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold
.     C         Am            Dm7      G
 I'd rather be His than have riches untold
.     C           C/Bb       F         C
 I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands
.     Am        Dm7         G           C
 I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand

[C]
.         G                F      C
 Than to be the king of a vast domain
.        G                    F    C
 And be held in sin's dread sway
.     C                     F    C
 I'd rather have Jesus than anything
.      C       G       C
 This world affords today

[V2]
.     C           C7         F        C
 I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause
.     C         Am         Dm7       G
 I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause
.     C           C/Bb       F         C
 I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame
.     Am        Dm7         G    C
 I'd rather be true to His holy name

[V3]
.      C           C7        F       C
 He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom
.       C           Am        Dm7      G
 He's sweeter than honey from out the comb
.     C           C/Bb        F     C
 He's all that my hungering spirit needs
.     Am          Dm7       G       C
 I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead</lyrics>
