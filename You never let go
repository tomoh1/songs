  <lyrics>[V1]
.              A2
 Even though I walk
.A2
 Through the valley of the shadow of death,
.      D2/F#
 Your perfect love is casting out fear.
.                   A2
 And even when I'm caught
.A2
 In the middle of the storms of this life,
.   D2/F#
 I won't turn back, I know You are near.

[P]
.                   F#m7 E A2
 And I will fear no evil,
.              F#m7  E A2
 For my God is with me.
.                 F#m7 E  A2
 And if my God is with me,
.                   E
 Whom then shall I fear?
.                   D2
 Whom then shall I fear?


[C]
.A2
 Oh no, You never let go,
.A2
 Through the calm and through the storm
.F#m7
 Oh no, You never let go,
.F#m7
 In every high and every low
.Esus
 Oh no, You never let go
.D2                           A2 Esus D2
 Lord, You never let go of me.

[V2]
 And I can see a light
 that is coming for the heart that holds on
 A glorious light beyond all compare.
 And there will be an end
 To these troubles, but until that day comes,
 We'll live to know You here on the earth.


[B]
.A2
 I can see a light that is coming
.A2
 for the heart that holds on,
.                     F#m7
 And there will be an end to these troubles,
.F#m7
 But until that day comes
.Esus
 Still I will praise You,
.D2                      A2 Esus D2
 still I will praise You.</lyrics>
