  <lyrics>[v1]
.G	       D   Em	          Bm
 One thing I ask, one thing I seek
.C	       G		Am        D
 That I may dwell in Your house, oh Lord.
.G	     D     Em	        Bm
 All of my days, all of my life,
.C	     Dsus    D     G
 That I may see    You, Lord.

[c]
.    Em      Am        Em       C
 One thing I ask, one thing I desire
.       G   C          G   C
 Is to see You, is to see You.

[v2]
 Hear me oh Lord.  Hear me when I cry.
 Lord, do not hide Your face from me
 You have been my strength,
 You have been my shield.
 And You will lift me up.
