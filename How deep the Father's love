.D Bm A G

[V1]
.     D                 Em   D  G        D               Asus-A
 How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure
.     D                  Em-D  G       D                A    D
 That he should give his only son, to make a wretch his treasure
.                       Em-D     G        D                 Bm    A
 How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turned his face away
.    D                    Em-D   G          D           A   D
 As wounds which mar the chosen one, bring many sons to glory

[V2]
.     D         Em   D  G        D               Asus-A
 Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders
. D                  Em-D     G         D             A    D
 Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers
.                    Em   D     G    D             Bm    A
 It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished
.    D                    Em  D   G       D               A   D
 His dying breath has brought me life; I know that it is finished

[V3]
. D                  Em D  G        D                 Asus-A
 I will not boast in anything: no gifts, no power, no wisdom
.  D                  Em-D   G          D             A    D
 But I will boast in Jesus Christ; his death and resurrection
.                        Em  D  G      D             Bm A
 Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer
.    D                 Em  D   G          D                 A   D
 But this I know with all my heart: his wounds have paid my ransom</lyrics>
