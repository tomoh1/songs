  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                     D
 I once was fatherless, a stranger with no hope
.A                        D
 Your kindness wakened me, wakened me, from my sleep ||
.A                           D
 Your love it beckons deeply, a call to come and die
.A                             D
 By grace now I will come and take this life, take your life

[P]
.F#m      E             D
 Sin has lost its power, death has lost its sting
.F#m        E               D
 From the grave You've risen victoriously

[C]
.A        
 Into marvelous light I'm running
.D
 Out of darkness, out of shame
.F#m               E
 By the cross You are the truth
.    D
 You are the life, You are the way

[V2]
 My dead heart now is beating, my deepest stains now clean
 Your breath fills up my lungs, now I'm free, now I'm free
 (Repeat)

[B]
.A
 Lift my hands and spin around
.D
 See the light that I have found
.F#m     E                    D
 Oh the marvelous light, the marvelous light</lyrics>
