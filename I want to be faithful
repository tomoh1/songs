  <lyrics>[V1]
.         E
 So many times Iâ€™ve failed
.            E
 And I have turned away
.           C#m7    B
 But I will never leave
.                 A     E
 For You are so faithful
.            E
 I can just see in You
.             E
 All that is just and true
.            C#m7     B
 Less of me, more of You
.           A     E
 I am Your servant

[C]
.               A          B
 I want to be faithful to You
.              F#m   C#m7
 I want to be true, Lord
.              A           B
 Whatever You say, I will do
.         E
 I will obey

[V2]
 Help me to walk in truth
 Never to stray from You
 Lead me in righteousness
 I want to follow
 Teach me to lose my life
 That I would be found in You
 Better to lose it all
 To be found in Jesus</lyrics>
