.               Am  F C   G
 It's all about you,  Jesus
.                 Am   F            C              G
 And all this is for you, for your glory and your fame
.               Am  F      C                    F
 It's not about me,  as if you should do things my way
.Am             G             F             C
 You alone are God and I surrender to your ways
