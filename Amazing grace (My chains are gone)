.E B/E E B/E

[V1]
.  E                 A/E
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
.      E                  B/E
 That saved a wretch like me
.  E         E/G#      A       E
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
.      E         B/E   E
 Was blind, but now I see

[V2]
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
 And grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believed

[C]
.               A                    E/G#
 My chains are gone, I've been set free
.           A                    E/B
 My God my saviour has ransomed me
.             A               E/G#
 And like a flood, His mercy rains
.          F#m B          E
 Unending love, amazing grace

[V3]
 The Lord has promised good to me
 His word my hope secures
 He will my shield and portion be
 As long as life endures

[V4]
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
 The sun forbear to shine
 But God, Who called me here below
 Will be forever mine</lyrics>
