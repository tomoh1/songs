  <title>No Longer Slaves</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.       E
 You unravel me with a melody
.        A         B     C#m
 You surround me with a song
.      E
 Of deliverance from my enemies
.     A       B         E
 Till all my fears are gone

[C]
.        A         B       E
 I'm no longer a slave to fear
.C#m       B      E
 I am a child of God

[Interlude]
.C#m B E A
.C#m B E A

[V2]
.         E
 From my Mother's womb
.           G#m
 You have chosen me
.A         B         E
 Love has called my name
.           E                    G#m
 I've been born again into Your family
.       A            B        E
 Your blood flows through my veins

[B]
.C#m            B              E            A
 You split the sea so I could walk right through it
.C#m             B                 E
 My fears were drowned in perfect love
.C#m          B              E         G#m
 You rescued me so I could stand and sing
.  A      B       E
 I am a child of God</lyrics>
