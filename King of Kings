  <lyrics>[v1]
.       D/F#               G
 In the darkness we were waiting
.         A             D
 Without hope without light
.           D/F#             G
 Till from heaven You came running
.           A             D
 There was mercy in Your eyes |||
.    D/F#                G
 To fulfill the law and prophets
.      A                D
 To a virgin came the Word
.        D/F#               G
 From a throne of endless glory
.      A             D
 To a cradle in the dirt

[C]
.D
 Praise the Father
.G2
 Praise the Son
.Bm7                D/A      A
 Praise the Spirit three in One
.D             G2
 God of glory, Majesty
.Bm7        G           A       D
 Praise forever to the King of Kings

[v2]
 To reveal the kingdom coming
 And to reconcile the lost
 To redeem the whole creation
 You did not despise the cross |||
 For even in Your suffering
 You saw to the other side
 Knowing this was our salvation
 Jesus for our sake You died

[v3]
.         Bm               G
 And the morning that You rose
.        A                D
 All of heaven held its breath
.           Bm                   G
 Till that stone was moved for good
.         A                   D
 For the Lamb had conquered death |||
.         Bm                    G
 And the dead rose from their tombs
.         A               D
 And the angels stood in awe
.         Bm                 G
 For the souls of all who’d come
.        A             D
 To the Father are restored

[v4]
.         D/F#                 G
 And the Church of Christ was born
.         A               D
 Then the Spirit lit the flame
.         D/F#             G
 Now this gospel truth of old
.          A                D
 Shall not kneel shall not faint |||
.        D/F#             G
 By His blood and in His Name
.        A            D
 In His freedom I am free
.        D/F#           G
 For the love of Jesus Christ
.        A           D
 Who has resurrected me

[Outro]
.D/F#      G2           A       D
 Praise forever to the King of Kings
