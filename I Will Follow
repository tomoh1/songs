.            E
 I've found love, as deep as the ocean,
.          A   B A/C#      B/D#            E
 And your eyes,       they hit me like a train
.          C#m    Caug        
 And your words serenade me 
.           E/B        Eaug/Bb  A
 Like the sweetest of songs
.              B     E
 Here I find peace again

[C]
.E              A       F#m
 I will follow, I will follow
.E              A	   F#m    E
 I will follow, I will follow

[V2]
 There's a song, and it's louder than music
 Can you hear me when there's no sound?
 Joy, 'cause I dance with the angels
 Take me higher, I'm not coming down.
 And your words serenade me like the sweetest of songs
 Here I find peace again</lyrics>
