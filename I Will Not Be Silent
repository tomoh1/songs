[2]
.C                  G/B                          C
 The flowers of the field are cryâ€™n to be heard
.                  G/B        D
 The trees of the forest are singing
.C                   G/B                  C
 And all of the mountains with one voice
.                 G/B   D         C    G/B C Amsus
 Are joining the chorus of this world

.G          D/F#           Em
 And I will not be silent, NO
.        C               G
 I will not be quiet anymore (repeat)
. G   G/F#  Em  C
 Anymore...

.G                    D/F#
 Running through the forest
.               Em
 Dive into the lake
.      C                G
 Bare feet on beaches white
.G                D/F#
 Standing in the canyon
.                Em
 Painted hills around
.    C
 The wind against my skin
---
[4]
.G
 Every ocean, every sea
.D/F#
 Every river, every stream
.Em
 Every mountain, every tree
.C
 Every blade of grass will sing

[C2]
.        G     Dsus          Em   C       G    Dsus Em C
 Make a joyful noise to the LORD all the earth

 Make a joyful noise to the LORD all the earth
