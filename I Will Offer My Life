[V1]
.D                   G         A         D
 I will offer up my life in spirit and truth
.                        G          A          D
 Pouring out the oil of love as my worship to You
.                     G       A     Bm
 In surrender I must give my every part
.                        G          A     D
 Lord, receive the sacrifice of a broken heart

[C]
.                    G     A          D
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
.                   G             A       D
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King
.                     G      A           D
 Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
.                     G             A              D
 As a praise of Your name for the things You have done||
.                        Em        D/F#    G
 Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part
.        Em      D/F#         G        A            D
 Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart

[v2]
 You deserve my every breath, for Youâ€™ve paid the great cost
 Giving up Your life to death, even death on a cross
 You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
 Opened up the gates of heaven, and have beckoned me in

[b]
.Em              D/F#
 What can I give, what can I bring
.G                                 Em D/F# G
 What can I sing as an offering, Lord</lyrics>
