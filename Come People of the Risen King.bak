[V1]
.       G             Em
 Come, people of the Risen King,
.       Am                  D
 Who delight to bring Him praise;
.      G                  Em
 Come all and tune your hearts to sing
.        Am       D       G
 To the Morning Star of grace.||

.           C              Em
 From the shifting shadows of the earth
.         Am               D - C
 We will lift our eyes to Him,
.        G             Em
 Where steady arms of mercy reach
.    Am      D      G
 To gather children in.

[C]
.   D        Am
 Rejoice, Rejoice!
.    D                C - G/B
 Let every tongue rejoice!
.     D          Em  - Em/D
 One heart, one voice,
.   Am          D       G
 O Church of Christ, rejoice!

[V2]
 Come, those whose joy is morning sun,
 And those weeping through the night;
 Come, those who tell of battles won,
 And those struggling in the fight.||

 For His perfect love will never change,
 And His mercies never cease,
 But follow us through all our days
 With the certain hope of peace.

[Interlude]
.Em C G D
.Em C G D

[V3]
 Come, young and old from every land -
 Men and women of the faith;
 Come, those with full or empty hands -
 Find the riches of His grace.||

 Over all the world, His people sing -
 Shore to shore we hear them call
 The Truth that cries through every age:
 “Our God is all in all”!</lyrics>
