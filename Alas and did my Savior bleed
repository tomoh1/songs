.G          G/B     C       D       Em      Bm        C
 Alas!  And did my Savior bleed and did my Sovereign die
.       G    C         D      Em        C             D
 Would He devote that sacred head for such a worm as I?
.    G                C        D      Em    Bm       C
 Was it for sins that I had done He groaned upon the tree?
.  G      C      D      Em        C       D      G
 Amazing pity, grace unknown and love beyond degree!

[C]
.   Bm                  Em
 My God, why would You shed Your blood
.    C            D
 So pure and undefiled
.    Bm           Em
 To make a sinful one like me
.       C      D        G
 Your chosen precious child?


[V2]
 Well might the sun in darkness hide and shut his glories in
 When Christ the mighty Maker died for man the creature’s sin
 Thus might I hide my blushing face while His dear cross appears
 Dissolve my heart in thankfulness and melt mine eyes to tears</lyrics></song>
