  <lyrics>[v1]
.          A       Asus    A
 I cast my mind to Calvary
.            E                 F#m
 Where Jesus bled and died for me
.          D                       A
 I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
.          E             A
 My Savior on the cursed tree

[v2]
 His body bound and drenched in tears
 They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
 The entrance sealed by heavy stone
 Messiah still and all alone

[c]
.  A                      D        A
 O praise the name of the Lord our God
.  F#m                Esus E 
 O praise His name forever more
.    A/C#                 D         F#m
 For endless days we will sing Your praise
.   D        E        A
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

[v3]
 Then on the third at break of dawn
 The Son of heaven rose again
 O trampled death, where is your sting?
 The angels roar for Christ the King

[v4]
 He shall return in robes of white
 The blazing Son shall pierce the night
 And I will rise among the saints
 My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face</lyrics>
