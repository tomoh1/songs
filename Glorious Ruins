  <lyrics>[V1]                                
.            E
 When the mountains fall
.                  B
 And the tempest roars
.            C#m      A
 You are with me
.       E
 When creation falls
.                   B
 Still my soul will soar
.          C#m
 On Your mercy
 
[P]
.     A                   
 I'll walk through the fire
.        E
 With my head lifted high
.        C#m     
 And my spirit revived
.         B
 In Your story
.      A              
 I'll look to the cross
.      C#m
 As my failure is lost
.         E                     B 
 In the light of Your glorious grace
---
[C]
.                      E
 Let the ruins come to life
.                      A
 In the beauty of Your name
.                   E
 Rising up from the ashes
.                B
 God forever You reign||
.                      C#m
 And my soul will find refuge
.                      A
 In the shadow of Your wings
.                  E
 I will love You forever
.                 B
 And forever I'll sing
 
 
[V2]
 When the world caves in
 Still my hope will cling
 To Your promise
 When my courage ends
 Let my heart find strength
 In Your presence</lyrics></song>
