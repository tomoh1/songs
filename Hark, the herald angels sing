.G                 C      D      
 Hark! The herald angels sing,
.G       C      D       G
 “Glory to the newborn King;
.G                    C     D
 Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
.Bm       D       Asus   D
 God and sinners reconciled!”||

.G               C       D
 Joyful, all ye nations rise,
.G                C        D
 Join the triumph of the skies;
.C            Am    E    Am       
 With angelic host proclaim,
.D           G      C   D   G
 “Christ is born in Bethlehem!”

[V2]
 Hail the heav’nly Prince of Peace!
 Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
 Light and life to all He brings,
 Hope and healing in His wings.||

 Mild He lays His glory by,
 Born that man no more may die.
 Born to raise the sons of earth,
 Born to give us second birth.

[V3]
 Christ, by highest Heav’n adored;
 Christ the everlasting Lord;
 In our hearts, prepare Him room,
 Offspring of a virgin’s womb.||

 Born in flesh both God and man;
 Praise the wisdom of His plan,
 God with us has come to dwell,
 Jesus our Emmanuel.
