  <lyrics>[V1]
.           G             C  
 O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder 
.          G/D      D                     G    D
 Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
.            G                C
 I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
.                G/D      D             G    D
 Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed

[C]
.               G        C                G
 Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee 
.               Am7  D              G    D
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art
.               G        C                G
 Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee 
.               Am7  D              G
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art

[V2]
.                  G                 C  
 When through the woods and forest glades I wander
.              G/D         D              G    D
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
.             G                C
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
.              G/D       D                G    D
 And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze
---
[V3]
.             G                 C  
 And when I think that God His Son not sparing
.            G/D      D                G    D
 Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
.              G                C
 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
.            G/D      D            G    D
 He bled and died to take away my sin

[V4]
.                   G                  C  
 When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
.             G/D       D                  G    D
 And take me home what joy shall fill my heart
.              G            C
 Then shall I bow in humble adoration
.               G/D      D                  G    D
 And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art
