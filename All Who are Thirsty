.               G
 All who are thirsty
.             Bm
 All who are weak
.             C
 Come to the fountain
.                       Am    G/B  C 
 Dip your heart in the stream of life ||
.                       G
 Let the pain and the sorrow
.           Bm
 Be washed away,
.                     C
 In the wave of his mercy
.                       Am    G/B  C 
 As deep cries out to deep, we sing

[c]
. G                C
 Come Lord Jesus, come
. G                C
 Come Lord Jesus, come
. G                C
 Come Lord Jesus, come
. G                C
 Come Lord Jesus, come
