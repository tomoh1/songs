  <lyrics>;intro:
.G C Em D C(2x)

[V1]
.G 
 The cross before me the world behind
.Em
 No turning back raise the banner high
.D            C                G
 It's not for me It's all for you ||

 Let the heavens shake and split the sky
 Let the people clap their hands and cry
 It's not for us, it's all for you

[C]
. G                      F            C
 Not to us, but to your name be the glory
 Not to us, but to your name be the glory

[V2]
 Our hearts unfold before your throne
 The only place for those who know
 It's not for us, it's all for you ||
 Send your holy fire on this offering
 Let our worship burn for the world to see
 It's not for us, it's all for you

[B]
.       G                                  C
 The earth is shaking the mountains shouting It's all for you
.     Em                    D             C
 The waves are crashing, the sun is raging, It's all for you ||
.        G                         C
 The universe spinning and singing, It's all for you
.      Em             D               
 Your children dancing, dancing, dancing, 
.C                               G
 It's all for you, It's all for you</lyrics>
