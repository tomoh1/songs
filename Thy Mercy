.     G                    C
 Thy mercy my God is the theme of my song
.    Em                       C           D
 The joy of my heart and the boast of my tongue
.     Am         G/B             C           C#dim7
 Thy free grace alone, from the first to the last
.     Am        C           D             G
 Hath won my affection and bound my soul fast

[V2]
 Without Thy sweet mercy I could not live here
 My sin would reduce me to utter despair
 But through Thy free goodness my spirits revive
 And He that first made me still keeps me alive

[V3]
 Thy mercy is more than a match for my heart
 Which wonders to feel its own hardness depart
 Dissolved by Thy goodness, I fall to the ground
 And weep for the praise of the mercy I've found 

[B]
.Am7 C G D
.Am7 C D D

 Hallelujah, hallelujah...

[V4]
 Great Father of mercies! Thy goodness I own
 And the covenant love of Thy crucified Son
 All praise to the Spirit whose whisper divine
 Seals mercy and pardon and righteousness mine!
