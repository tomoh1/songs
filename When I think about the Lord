  <lyrics>[V1]
.         G              D
 When I think about the Lord
.         Em               E7
 How He saved me, How He raised me
.        Am                    Em              
 How He filled me up with the Holy Ghost
.        C                D
 How He healed me to the uttermost

[V2]
.         G              D
 When I think about the Lord
.        Em                  E7
 How He picked me up, and turned me around
.               Am  F          D
 How he set my feet on solid ground

[C]
.                 G          D 
 Makes me wanna shout, Hallelujah
.           Em
 Thank you Jesus
.             E7
 Lord you're worthy
.             Am
 Of all the glory
.         Em
 All the honor
.                 C   D
 And all of the praise</lyrics>
