.       Em              D                        Cadd9
 As we come today we remind ourselves of what we do
.             Em                 D                 Cadd9
 That these songs are not just songs but signs of love for You
.           Em    D2    G                  Em     D2      G
 This is a Holy moment now, something of heaven touches Earth
.           Em    D       G                   A
 Voices of angels all resound, we join their song

[C1]
.Em           D/F#         G       A
 Come, come, come, let us worship God
.          Em        D/F#           Cadd9    
 With our hands held high and our hearts bowed down
.        Em        D/F#              G       A   
 We will run, run, run through Your gates O God
.         Em         D/F#                 Cadd9
 With a shout of love, with a shout of love

[V2}
 Lord with confidence we come before Your throne of grace
 Not that we deserve to come, but you have paid the way
 You are the Holy King of all, heaven and Earth are in Your hands
 All the angels sing Your song, we join them now

[B]
