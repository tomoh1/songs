  <title>Be Still My Soul</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.D            G        A               D
 Be still my soul the Lord is on your side
.D            G       A                D
 Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain
.D              Bm     F#m          Em
 Leave to your God to order and provide
.           D        G        A      F#
 In ev'ry change He faithful will remain
.D            Bm       F#m        A         Em
 Be still my soul your best your heav'nly friend
.                D         G     A      D
 Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end

[V2]
 Be still my soul your God will undertake
 To guide the future as He has the past
 Your hope your confidence let nothing shake
 All now mysterious shall be bright at last
 Be still my soul the waves and winds still know
 His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below

[V3]
 Be still my soul when dearest friends depart
 And all is darkened in the vale of tears
 Then shall you better know His love His heart
 Who comes to soothe your sorrow and your fears
 Be still my soul your Jesus can repay
 From His own fullness all He takes away</lyrics>
