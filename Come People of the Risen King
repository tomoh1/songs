  <lyrics>[Intro]
.A D F#m Bm

[V1]
.       A             F#m
 Come, people of the Risen King,
.       Bm                  E
 Who delight to bring Him praise;
.      A                  F#m
 Come all and tune your hearts to sing
.        Bm       E       A
 To the Morning Star of grace.||

.           D              F#m
 From the shifting shadows of the earth
.         Bm               E - D
 We will lift our eyes to Him,
.        A             F#m
 Where steady arms of mercy reach
.    Bm      E      A
 To gather children in.

[C]
.   E        Bm
 Rejoice, Rejoice!
.    E                D - A/C#
 Let every tongue rejoice!
.     E          F#m - F#m/E
 One heart, one voice,
.   Bm          E       A
 O Church of Christ, rejoice!

[V2]
 Come, those whose joy is morning sun,
 And those weeping through the night;
 Come, those who tell of battles won,
 And those struggling in the fight.||

 For His perfect love will never change,
 And His mercies never cease,
 But follow us through all our days
 With the certain hope of peace.

[Interlude]
.F#m D A E
.F#m D A E

[V3]
 Come, young and old from every land -
 Men and women of the faith;
 Come, those with full or empty hands -
 Find the riches of His grace.||

 Over all the world, His people sing -
 Shore to shore we hear them call
 The Truth that cries through every age:
 “Our God is all in all”!</lyrics>
