.          F#m                  D
 There's a peace I've come to know
.           A                   E
 Though my heart and flesh may fail
.           F#m            D
 There's an anchor for my soul
.       A           E
 I can say, "It is well"

[P]
.A              E/G#
 Jesus has overcome
.          F#m          D
 And the grave is overwhelmed
.A/C#           E/G#
 The victory is won
.       F#m            D
 He is risen from the dead

[C]
.            A            E
 And I will rise when He calls my name
.F#m              D
 No more sorrow, no more pain
.        A               E
 I will rise on eagles' wings
.   F#m             D
 Before my God fall on my knees
.    A/C#    D
 And rise
.       A/E   E
 I will rise

[V2]
 There's a day that's drawing near
 When this darkness breaks to light
 And the shadows disappear
 And my faith shall be my eyes

[B]
.                D        A           E
 And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
. D     A       E
 Worthy is the Lamb
.                D       A    E        (F#m)
 And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
. D     A       E
 Worthy is the Lamb</lyrics>
