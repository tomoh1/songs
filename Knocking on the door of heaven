.E                               B
 We will give ourselves no rest,
.A
 'Til Your kingdom comes on earth
.F#m                               E
 We've positioned watchmen on the walls
.E				    B
 Now our prayers will fall like rain
.A
 For You've shared Your heart with us
.F#m				      E
 God of heaven, on our knees we fall

[P]
.      A       B
 Come down in power
 Reveal Your heart again.
 Come hear our cries.
 The tears that plead for rain

[C]
.E
 We're knocking, knocking on the door of heaven
.C#m
 We're crying, crying for this generation
.F#m
 We're praying for Your name to be known,
.A              B
 In all of the Earth
.E
 We're watching, watching on the walls to see You
.C#m
 We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough,
.F#m
 We're praying for Your word to bear fruit,
.A              B                    E
 In all of the Earth, in all of the Earth
