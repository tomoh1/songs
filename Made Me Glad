 I will bless the Lord forever
 I will trust Him at all times
 He has delivered me from all fear
 He has set my feet upon a rock 

.D
 I will not be moved
.Bm                   E
 And I'll say of the Lord

[C]
.              A          Bm
 You are my shield, my strength
.    D          E
 My portion, deliverer
.     A              A/C#
 My shelter, strong tower
.    D            E               (A)
 My very present help in time of need

[V2]
 Whom have I in heaven but You
 There's none I desire besides You

 You have made me glad 
 And I'll say of the Lord
