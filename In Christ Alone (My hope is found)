.    F       C       F       G
 In Christ alone my hope is found
.C/E       F          G           C
 He is my light, my strength, my song
.      F      C          F      G
 This cornerstone, this solid ground
.C/E               F         G           C
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

.      C/E        F                    G
 What heights of love, what depths of peace
.                 Am                      G/B
 When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
.    F     C       F     G
 My comforter, my all in all
.C/E          F         G       C
 Here in the love of Christ I stand


[V2]
.    F       C         F        G
 In Christ alone, Who took on flesh
.C/E          F      G        C
 Fullness of God in helpless babe
.      F       C        F       G
 This gift of love and righteousness
.C/E            F        G       C
 Scorned by the ones He came to save

.     C/E       F             G
 Till on that cross as Jesus died
.              Am          G/B
 The wrath of God was satisfied
.    F      C      F       G
 For every sin on Him was laid
.C/E           F         G      C
 Here in the death of Christ I live

[V3]
.      F        C         F    G
 There in the ground His body lay
.C/E           F        G         C
 Light of the world by darkness slain
.      F        C         F       G
 Then bursting forth in glorious day
.C/E           F       G     C
 Up from the grave He rose again

.    C/E     F             G
 And as He stands in victory
.                 Am               G/B
 Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
.    F     C       F     G
 For I am His and He is mine
.C/E               F        G        C      Asus
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ


[V4]
.    G        D        G       A
 No guilt in life, no fear in death
.D/F#         G          A       D
 This is the power of Christ in me
.      G             D     G      A
 From life's first cry to final breath
.D/F#      G        A    D
 Jesus commands my destiny

.   D/F#      G                  A
 No power of hell, no scheme of man
.           Bm               A/C#
 Can ever pluck me from His hand
.      G    D        G        A
 Till He returns or calls me home
.D/F#         G         A           D
 Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
