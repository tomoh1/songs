.D
 Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart,
.A                         G              A
 Naught be all else to me save that Thou art;
.G                       Bm         G    A
 Thou my best thought by day or by night,
.D         Bm7           G2          D
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

[V2]
 Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word,
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
 Thou my great Father, and I thy true son,
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

[V3]
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,
 Thou mine Inheritance now and always;
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
 High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

[V4]
 High King of heaven my victory won,
 May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun;
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.</lyrics>
