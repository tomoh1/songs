  <lyrics>[Intro
.A  F#m  A  F#m

[V1]
.A
 This is my revelation
.                    F#m
 Christ Jesus crucified
.A
 Salvation through repentance
.                          F#m
 At the cross on which He died

[V2]
 Now hear my absolution
 Forgiveness for my sin
 And I sink beneath the waters
 That Christ was buried in

[C]
.        D            A
 I will rise, I will rise
.     E                  F#m
 As Christ was raised to life
.        D           A     E
 Now in Him, now in Him I live

[V3]
 I stand a new creation, 
 Baptised in blood and fire
 No fear of condemnation 
 By faith I'm justified
---
[B]
.D
 I rise as You are risen
.A
 Declare Your rule and reign
.E
 My life confess Your lordship
.F#m
 And glorify Your name

 Your word it stands eternal
 Your Kingdom knows no end
 Your praise goes on forever
 And on and on again

 No power can stand against You
 No curse assault Your throne
 No one can steal Your glory
 For it is Yours alone

.D
 I stand to sing Your praises
.A
 I stand to testify
.E
 For I was dead in my sin
.E
 But now...</lyrics></song>
