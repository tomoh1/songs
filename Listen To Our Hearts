.               A                   C#m
 How do you explain?  How do you describe
.	                 A           B                                        
 A love that goes from east to west, 
.                           C#m
 And runs as deep as it is wide?||
.                  A                              C#m
 You know all our hopes.  Lord, you know all our fears
.                     A                B
 And words cannot express the love we feel,
.		           C#m
 But we long for You to hear.

[C]
.                   A                       C#m
 So listen to our hearts, hear our spirits sing
.                        A   B/D#	 
 A song of praise that flows 
.                        E
 From those You have redeemed||
.                     A 
 And we will use the words we know 
.    B                 E     B/D#    C#m
 To tell you what an awesome God you are
.                    A                         B
 But words are not enough, to tell You of our love
.                   E
 So listen to our hearts…

[V2]
 If words could fall like rain from these lips of mine
 And if I had a thousand years, 
 I would still run out of time.||
 So if You’ll listen to my heart, every beat would say
 “You for the life, thank You for the truth,
 Thank You for the way…”</lyrics>
