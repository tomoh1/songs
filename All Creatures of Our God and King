 All creatures of our God and King

 Lift up your voice and with us sing

 O praise Him, alleluia

 Thou burning sun with golden beam
.Bm
 Thou silver moon with softer gleam
.    G            D/F#
 O praise Him, O praise Him
.     G       D/F#        Em A D
 Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia

[V2]
 Thou rushing wind that art so strong
 Ye clouds that sail in heavâ€™n along
 O praise Him, alleluia
 Thou rising moon in praise rejoice
 Ye lights of evening find a voice
 O praise Him, O praise Him
 Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia


[v3]
 Let all things their Creator bless
 And worship Him in humbleness
 O praise Him, alleluia
 Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
 And praise the Spirit, three in One
 O praise Him, O praise Him
 Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia</lyrics>
