[V1]
.    G             Gsus
 Oh, I've heard a thousand stories
.    G         Gsus
 Of what they think You're like
.    G               Gsus
 But I've heard the tender whisper
.    G          Gsus
 Of love in the dead of night
.     C       G/B
 You tell me that You're pleased
.         Am          D  Dsus
 And that I'm never alone

[C]
.                     C
 You're a Good, Good Father
.                 G/B
 It's who You are, It's who You are,
.Am              D
 It's who You are
.                  C
 and I'm loved by You
.               G/B
 It's who I am, It's who I am,
.Am           D
 It's who I am

.G          Gsus
 I've seen many searching
.     G      Gsus
 For answers far and wide
.    G       Gsus
 But I know we're all searching
.    G            Gsus
 For answers only You provide
.            C         G/B
 'Cause You know just what we need
.       Am        D
 Before we say a word

[B]
.          C                     Em
 You are perfect in all of your ways
.          Am                    G
 You are perfect in all of your ways
.          C                     Em     D
 You are perfect in all of your ways to us

[V3]
.         G      Gsus
 Oh it's Love so undeniable
.G         Gsus
 I, I can hardly speak
.G        Gsus
 Peace so Unexplainable
.G        Gsus
 I, I can hardly think||
.        C       G/B
 As You call me deeper still
.        Am      G/B
 As You call me deeper still
.        C       G/B
 As You call me deeper still
.     Am         D
