. C  C/E   F   C
. F C - F  G   C

[V1]
.        C      C/E
 Oh how good it is
.          F         C
 When the family of God
.        F            C
 Dwells together in spirit
.     Am       G
 In faith and unity.
.           C         C/E
 Where the bonds of peace,
.      F             C
 Of acceptance and love
.          F              C  -  F
 Are the fruit of His presence
.       G   C
 Here among us

[C]
.    G                    F           C
 So with one voice we'll sing to the Lord
.    G                     F            G
 And with one heart we'll live out His word
.          C           C/E
 Till the whole earth sees
.        F         C
 The Redeemer has come
.         F               C  - F        G     C
 For He dwells in the presence of His people.

[V2]
 Oh how good it is
 On this journey we share
 To rejoice with the happy
 And weep with those who mourn.
 For the weak find strength
 The afflicted find grace
 When we offer the blessing
 Of belonging

[Interlude]

.G F/G C/G G

[V3]
 Oh how good it is
 To embrace His command
 To prefer one another
 Forgive as He forgives.
 When we live as one
 We all share in the love
 Of the Son with the Father
 And the Spirit</lyrics>
