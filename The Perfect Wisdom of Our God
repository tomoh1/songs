.G/B  C   D   Em
.G/B          C


[V1]
.     G/B    C      D       Em
 The perfect wisdom of our God
.   D/F#     G       C    D
 Revealed in all the universe
.     G/B      C     D      Em
 All things created by His hand
.    C      G/B        D      G
 And held together at His command

[C1]
.    Em        D/F#     G       C
 He knows the mysteries of the seas,
.     Em    D/F#      G        D
 The secrets of the stars are His;
.     Em        D/F#     G       C
 He guides the planets on their way
.     Am        G/B            D      G
 And turns the earth through another day.


[V2]
 The matchless wisdom of His ways
 That mark the path of righteousness;
 His word a lamp unto my feet,
 His Spirit teaching and guiding me.

[C2]
 And O the mystery of the cross,
 That God should suffer for the lost,
 So that the fool might shame the wise,
 And all the glory might go to Christ!
---

[Interlude]
.Am  D   Em  G
.Am  D   Em  G
.Am  D   Em  G
.Am  D   Em


[V3]
 O grant me wisdom from above,
 To pray for peace and cling to love,
 And teach me humbly to receive
 The sun and rain of Your sovereignty.

[C3]
 Each strand of sorrow has a place
 Within this tapestry of grace;
 So through the trials I choose to say:
 “Your perfect will in Your perfect way.”
