.G                   Am
 No eye has seen and no ear has heard
.     G/B                  C     D           
 And no mind has ever conceived
.      G                   Am
 The glorious things that You have prepared
.     G/B                 Dsus  D
 For everyone who has believed

[P1]
.F                            A/C#           A
 You brought us near and You called us Your own
.     Am7                           Dsus D
 And made us joint heirs with Your Son

[C]
.     G                      Am
 How high and how wide, how deep and how long
.      F              C            D
 How sweet and how strong is Your love
.     G                      Am
 How lavish Your grace, how faithful Your ways
.      C            D       G
 How great is Your love, O Lord

[V2]
 Objects of mercy who should have known wrath
 Weâ€™re filled with unspeakable joy
 Riches of wisdom, unsearchable wealth
 And the wonder of knowing Your voice

[P2]
 You are our treasure and our great reward
 Our hope and our glorious King</lyrics>
