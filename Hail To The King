.     G                   Em
 You came to us a man, in very nature God,
.  C 
 Pierced for our iniquities 
.       Dsus            D
 As you hung upon the cross,
.     G              Em
 But God exalted You to the highest place
.     C                                                        
 And gave to You the right to bear 
.    Dsus            D
 The name above all names ||

.     C              Dsus  D          Em  Em/D
 That at the name of Jesus we should bow
.     C            Cm/Eb                Em  Em/D
 And every tongue confess that You are Lord
.      C               Dsus  D 
 And when You come in glory
.        Em     D  C            Dsus  D
 For the world to see, we will sing

[C]
.G            C
 Hail to the King 
.   Am        Am/G        Dsus   D
 In all His splendor and majesty
.Em  D/F#  G    C     Am              
 Hail to the King of Kings, 
.      G  C   D   G
 Lord Jesus, our God
---
[V2]
 We eagerly await the coming of the day
 when the glory of the risen King will shine upon the earth.     
 Then rival thrones will fall before the Lord of all         
 And hail supreme authority in the true and living God || 
 At the name of Jesus we will bow 
 as every tongue confesses You as Lord
 When You come in glory for the world to see, we will sing</lyrics>
