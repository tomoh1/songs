.C
 What's not to love about You?
.
 Heaven and earth adore You
.Am
 Kings and kingdoms bow down
.                        G
 Son of God, You are the One
.            F
 You are the One we're living for

[V2]
.C
 You are the love that frees us
.
 You are the light that leads us
.Am
 Like a fire burning
.                        G
 Son of God, You are the One
.            F                 Am G
 You are the One we're living for

.C
 We will sing, sing, sing
.
 And make music with the heavens
.         Am
 We will sing, sing, sing
.
 Grateful that You hear us
.          G
 When we shout your praise
.      F                C
 Lift high the name of Jesus
