.D               A                      Em
 When the music fades all is stripped away
.              A
 And I simply come
.D                 A                        Em
 Longing just to bring something that's of worth
.                      A
 That will bless Your heart

[P]
.Em              D/F#         A                  Em
 I'll bring You more than a song for a song in itself
.             D/F#        A
 Is not what You have required
.Em                D/F#     A                           Em
 You search much deeper within through the way things appear
.                D/F#     A
 You're looking into my heart

[C]
.D                       A
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship
.         Em
 And it's all about You
.      G         A      D
 It's all about You, Jesus
.                           A
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
.          Em
 When it's all about You
.      G         A      D
 It's all about You, Jesus

[V2]
 King of endless worth no one could express
 How much You deserve
 Though I'm weak and poor all I have is Yours
 Every single breath</lyrics>
