.G      D         Em       D
 Jesus lives, and so shall I
. Bm          D/F#     A     G  D
 Death, thy sting is gone forever!
.G       D         Em      D
 He who bowed His head to die
.Bm          D/F#    A       Em  D
 Lives the bands of death to sever
.G         D        G        D
 He shall raise me from the dust
.G      D     G         D
 Jesus is my Hope and Trust

 Jesus is my Hope and Trust
 ​
[V2]
.G      D            Em       D
 Jesus lives, though once He died. 
.Bm      D/F#      A      G  D
 In the ground He was forsaken.
.G          D        Em      D
 Yet, the stone was rolled aside! 
.Bm      D/F#      A         Em  D
 How the gates of hell were shaken!

 Death obeys Him, yes it must;
.G      D     G         D
 Jesus is my Hope and Trust.
.G      D     Em        D
 Jesus is my Hope and Trust.

 And His kingdom still remaining,

 Naught from Him my heart can sever,

 Life, nor death, nor pow'rs of hell,
.Bm       D/F#         A      Em  D
 Joy, nor grief, henceforth forever.
.G       D        G         D
 None of all His saints is lost;

 Jesus is my Hope and Trust.

 Jesus is my Hope and Trust.
