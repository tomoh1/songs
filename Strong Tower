  <lyrics>.B A C#m

[V1]
.B          A               C#m
 When I wander through the desert
.                        B
 And I'm longing for my home
.               A         C#m    B
 All my dreams have gone astray
.B              A          C#m
 When I'm stranded in the valley
.                        B
 And I'm tired and all alone
.                 A       C#m
 It seems like I lost my way

[P]
.F#m                   A
 I go running to Your mountain
.F#m                       A
 Where Your mercy sets me free

[C]
.                   E
 You are my strong tower
.             C#m
 Shelter over me
.               A
 Beautiful and mighty
.             A
 Everlasting King
.A          B       E
 You are my strong tower
.                   C#m
 Fortress when I'm weak
.                       A
 Your name is true and holy
.          B       C#m   A
 And your face is all I seek
---
[V2]
 In the middle of my darkness
 In the midst of all my fear
 You're my refuge and my hope

 When the storm of life is raging
 And the thunder's all I hear
 You speak softly to my soul
