  <lyrics>[V1]
.       C#m           B          F#m 
 I have made You too small in my eyes,
.    A   B    C#m
 Oh Lord, forgive me.
.   C#m         B          F#m 
 And I have believed in a lie,
.      A         B        C#m
 That You were unable to help me.

[P1]
.E           B       F#m    
 But now oh Lord, I see my wrong,
.A        B         C#m             B
 Heal my heart and show Yourself strong.
.E          B        F#m
 And in my eyes and with my song,
.A         B    C#m      A        B     E
 Lord, be magnified, Oh Lord, be magnified.

[C]
.    E    B        F#m   A        E       D     B
 Be magnified, oh Lord.  You are highly exalted. 
.G#m                   A         E 
 And there is nothing You can't do.
.A   B       C#m          B
 Oh Lord, my eyes are on You.
.   C#m-B-C#m     A        B    E
 Be magnified, Oh Lord, be magnified.

[V2]
 I have leaned on the wisdom of men.
 Oh Lord, forgive me.
 And I have responded to them,
 Instead of Your light and Your mercy.

[P2]
 But now oh Lord, I see my wrong,
 Heal my heart and show Yourself strong.
 And in my eyes and with my song,
 Lord, be magnified, Oh Lord, be magnified.</lyrics>
