.A
 Did you feel the mountains tremble?
.D/F#
 Did you hear the oceans roar?
.Bm7
 When the people rose to sing of
.D                 E    A   A  Esus  A  Esus
 Jesus Christ the risen One

[V2]
.A
 Did you feel the people tremble?
.D/F#
 Did you hear the singers roar?
.A
 When the lost began to sing of
.D                 E    A     A
 Jesus Christ the saving one

[P1]
.            D/F#                A
 And we can see that God you're moving
.          D/F#              A
 A mighty river through the nations
.              D/F#              A/C#
 And young and old will turn to Jesus
.Bm7                              A/C#
 Fling wide your heavenly gates
.D                      Esus  A    Esus A Esus
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord

.A                      D/F#
 Open up the doors and let the music play
.Bm7                           A       Esus
 Let the streets resound with singing
.A                            D/F#
 Songs that bring your hope, songs that bring your joy
.Bm7                       A      Esus  A
 Dancers who dance upon injustice
[V2]
 Did you feel the darkness tremble?
 When all the saints join in one song
 And all the streams flow as one river
 To wash away our brokeness

[P2]
 And here we see that God you're moving
 A time of Jubilee is coming
 When young and old return to Jesus
 Fling wide your heavenly gates
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord</lyrics>
