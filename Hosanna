[V1]
.E
 I see the King of glory
.C#m
 Coming on the clouds with fire
.                  F#m
 The whole earth shakes
.                  B
 The whole earth shakes

.C#m

.E 
 I see His love and mercy
.C#m
 Washing over all our sin
.            F#m
 The people sing
.            B
 The people sing

[C]
.E/G#  A     B   C#m
 Hosanna, Hosanna
.   A            C#m     B
 Hosanna in the Highest
.E/G#  A     B   C#m
 Hosanna, Hosanna

[V2]
 I see a generation
 Rising up to take their place
 With selfless faith
 With selfless faith
 I see a near revival
 Stirring as we pray and seek
 We're on our knees
 We're on our knees

[B]
.A                           B
 Heal my heart and make it clean
.E                        C#m
 Open up my eyes to the things unseen
.A                         B              C#m
 Show me how to love like You have loved me
.A                               B
 Break my heart for what breaks Yours
.E                         C#m
 Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
.A                       B          Amaj7
 As I walk from earth into eternity</lyrics></song>
