[V1]
.             C#m     B         E
 Let now the weak say I have strength
.         F#m      C#m
 By the Spirit of power
.      C#m            B       E
 That raised Christ from the dead
.             C#m       B       E
 Let now the poor stand and confess
.         F#m        C#m
 That my portion is Him
.         C#m   B    E
 And I'm more than blessed

[P]
.C#m
 Let now our hearts burn with a flame
.A
 A fire consuming all
.     E          B
 For Your Son's holy Name
.C#m
 And with the heavens we declare
.A            F#m7 B
 You are our King

[C]
.             E
 We love You Lord
.            C#m
 We worship You
.             B
 You are our God
.               E
 You alone are good

 You asked Your Son
 To carry this
 The heavy cross
 Our weight of sin

[V2]
.               C#m        B        E
 Let now Your church shine as the bride
.          F#m         C#m
 That You saw in Your heart
.       C#m     B        E
 As You offered up Your life
.             C#m      B       E
 And now the lost be welcomed home
.        F#m         C#m
 By the saved and redeemed
.        C#m    B      E
 Those adopted as Your own

[C2]
 I love You Lord
 I worship You
 Hope which was lost
 Now stands renewed
 I give my life
 To honour this
 The love of Christ
