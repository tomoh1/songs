  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm                A                    G
 Before I spoke a word You were singing over me
.Bm             A          G
 You have been so so good to me
.Bm                A                       G
 Before I took a breath You breathed Your life in me
.Bm             A          G
 You have been so so kind to me

[C]
.      Bm            A
 O the overwhelming never-ending
.G                 D
 Reckless love of God
.      Bm             A
 O it chases me down fights 'til I'm found
.G                  D
 Leaves the ninety-nine
.            Bm                A
 I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it
.           G              D
 Still You give Yourself away
.      Bm            A
 O the overwhelming never-ending
.G                 D
 Reckless love of God

[V2]
.Bm               A                   G
 When I was Your foe still Your love fought for me
.Bm             A          G
 You have been so so good to me
.Bm             A                G
 When I had no worth You paid it all for me
.Bm             A          G
 You have been so so kind to me

[B]
.Bm                           A
 There's no shadow You won't light up
.                     G
 Mountain You won't climb up
.              D
 Coming after me
.Bm                         A
 There's no wall You won't kick down
.               G
 Lie You won't tear down
.              D
 Coming after me</lyrics>
