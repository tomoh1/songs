[V1]
.B     G#m          F#       E
 God above all the world in motion
.B     G#m         F#        E
 God above all my hopes and fears
.B            G#m           F#          E      G#m9
 And I don't care what the world throws at me now
.E
 I'm gonna be alright

.B E F# G#m
.B E F#

[V2]
 Hear the sounds of the generations
 Making loud our freedom song
 All in all that the world would know Your name
 We're gonna be alright
