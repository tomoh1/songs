.A E/G# A B
 
[V1]
.E   A           B        C#m
 Oh Lord You’ve searched me 
.E    A       B
 You know my way 
.E      A     B    C#m
 Even when I fail You 
.A            B
 I know You love me 
 
 
 Your holy presence 
 Surrounding me 
 In every season 
 I know You love me 
 I know You love me 
 
[C]
.E              B/D#   C#m
 At the cross I bow my knee 
.                      E/G#   A
 Where Your blood was shed for me 
.                               B
 There’s no greater love than this 
.E           B/D#        C#m
 You have overcome the grave 
.                     E/G#      A
 Your glory fills the highest place 
.                      B
 What can separate me now 
 
[V2]
 You go before me 
 You shield my way 
 Your hand upholds me 
 I know You love me

[B]
.              E/G#
 You tore the veil 
.B           C#m
 You made a way 
.          A       C#m      B
 When You said that it is done 
 
[V3]
 And when the earth fades 
 Falls from my eyes 
 And You stand before me 
 I know You love me 
 I know You love me</lyrics>
