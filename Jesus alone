.A             D          F#m      E      D 
 Father, open up our eyes, to see Jesus alone
.A                D            F#m           E      D
 Spirit, give us ears to hear, the words of Jesus alone
.         Bm7             E
 We have put our hope in mortal man
.Bm           D	          E
 But we will turn back to You

[C]
.A                         E
 Lord, we fix our eyes on You
.         Bm7	      A       D	          A
 You are head of the church, chief cornerstone
.     D	      A  E
 The only foundation
.A                         E
 Lord, we fix our eyes on You
.            Bm7       A       D	         A
 Youâ€™re the mighty commander, King of all kings
.D         A E A
 Lord of glory

[V2]
 Jesus, there is no one else, full of wisdom and grace
 Jesus, there is no one else
 Who could ever take Your place
 We have put our hope in mortal man
 But we will turn back to You</lyrics>
