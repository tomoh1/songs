 You were the Word at the beginning
.          F       Am        G
 One with God the Lord most high
.Am               G/B     C
 Your hidden glory in creation
.        F       Am         G
 Now revealed in You our Christ

[C1]
.                         C
 What a beautiful name it is

 What a beautiful name it is
.             Am      G       F
 The name of Jesus Christ my king
.                        C/E
 What a beautiful name it is

 Nothing compares to this
.                         Am
 What a beautiful name it is
.     G       F
 The name of Jesus

[V2]
 We couldn't have heaven without you
 So Jesus you brought heaven down 
 My sin was great your love was greater 
 What could separate us now? 

[C2]
 What a wonderful name it is 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 The name of Jesus Christ my king 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 Nothing compares to this 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 The name of Jesus 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 The name of Jesus

.                 F
 Death could not hold you
.                 G
 The veil tore before you
.                 Am                Em
 You silence the boast of sin and grave
.                 F                           G
 The heavens are roaring the praise of your glory
.             Am             G
 For you are raised to life again ||
.             F                 G
 You have no rival, you have no equal
.           Am            Em
 Now and forever God you reign
.              F                      G
 Yours is the kingdom, yours is the glory
.              Am              G
 Yours is the name above all names

 Nothing can stand against 
 What a powerful name it is 
 The name of Jesus
