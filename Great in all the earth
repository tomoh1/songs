.G Em C D

[V1]
.     G
 The world is Yours and everything in it
.     Em
 It's all at Your command
.             C           D
 There is no end to Your domain...

[V2]
.      G
 The planets shake, the galaxies tremble
.      Em
 They turn within Your hand
.            C            D
 There is no end to Your domain
.     C                        D
 No height or depth You don't sustain

[C]
.G
 Great in all the earth is Your glory oh God
.    Em
 The universe declares how amazing You are
.      C            D
 Over history and eternity
.     C                   D
 You alone are Lord and King

[V3]
 The world is Yours and everything in it
 It's all at Your command
 There is no end to Your domain
 No height or depth You don't sustain

[B]
.Am       G         D
 There is none like You (repeat)
