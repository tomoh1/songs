  <lyrics>[V1]
.C             F
 In the quiet, in the stillness 
.   Dm               G
 I know that You are God
.C             F
 In the secret of Your presence 
.   Dm                 G
 I know there I am restored

.Dm7   G   C     F        G
 When you call I won't refuse
.Dm7   G   C     F          G
 Each new day, again I'll choose

[C]
.Am               F    C   G
 There is no one else for me
.Dm7            Am
 None but Jesus
.Am            F   C   G
 Crucified to set me free
.       Dm7
 Now I live to bring Him praise

[V2]
 In the chaos, in confusion 
 I know you're sovereign still
 In the moment of my weakness 
 You give me grace to do your will

 When you call I won't delay
 This my song through all my days

[Interlude]
.Am  F  G  C

[B]
.Am        F       C       G     
 All my delight is in you Lord
.           Dm
 All of my hope
.             Am
 All of my strength
.Am         F      C       G
 All my delight is in you Lord
.        Dm   Am
 Forevermore</lyrics>
