  <lyrics>[V1]
.C            Dm             G        C
 Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
.F           C/E        D7           G
 There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
.G7            C           C7            F
 Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not;
.Dm7         C/E             G         C
 As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be.
 
[C]
.G             C             A            Dm
 Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy faithfulness!
.G          C           D7        G
 Morning by morning new mercies I see;
.G7         C           C7            F
 All I have needed, Thy hands hath provided--
.Dm7           C/E             G        C
 Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me!
 
[V2]
 Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
 Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
 Join with all nature in manifold witness
 To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
 
[V3]
 Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
 Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
 Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
 Blessings all mine with ten thousands beside.</lyrics>
