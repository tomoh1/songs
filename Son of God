.G                          Em
 Son of God, shaper of the stars
.                              C
 You alone, the dweller of my heart
.                               D
 Mighty King, how beautiful You are
.      C
 How beautiful||
 
 Son of God, the Father's gift to us
 You alone were broken on the altar of love
 Precious lamb, our freedom's in Your blood
 It's in Your blood
 
[C]
.G          C
 Jesus, oh Holy One
.   D               G    D/F#    
 I sing to you, forgiven
. Em          Am
 Savior, I'm overcome
.      C          D        G
 With Your great love for me
 
[V2]
 Son of God, strength beyond compare
 You alone, the darkness cannot bear
 Lord of love, Your kindness draws me near
 It draws me||
 
 Son of God, prophecy of hope
 You alone, redeemer of my soul
 Come again, and lead Your people home
 Come lead us home
