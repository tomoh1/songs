.A   A/C#    D             A
 Oh Lord I give You all I have
.        A/C#      D   A
 But it seems so little
.         A/C#  D           A  A/C# D A
 When You have given me so much

.    A/C#    D             A
 I come to You with empty hands
.  A/C#  D                 A
 And a heart that's fragile
.     A/C#    D                   E
 You come to me with a wealth of love

[C]
.A        D    E
 Oh Lord Your love
.A       D   E
 Is new with every morning
.A          D  E
 Your faithfulness
.    F#m            D    E
 It gets me through the night
.A       D   E
 You bid me come
.A          D   E
 You know that I am weary
.A         D   E
 Your yoke is easy
.     F#m   E/G#  A
 Your burden is light

[V2]
 And now I sing You songs of praise
 But Your greatness is beyond me
 I know I cannot comprehend
 How You ancient of days
 Stoop Yourself to call me
 To be Your son, to be Your friend</lyrics>
