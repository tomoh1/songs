  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C Csus C Csus

[V1]
.C F G F

 There’s no darkness in Your eyes
 There’s no question in Your mind
 God almighty
 God of mercy

 There’s no hiding from Your face
 There’s no striving in Your grace
 God of mercy
 God almighty

[C1]
 Let there be light
 Open the eyes of the blind
 Purify our hearts in Your fire
 Breathe in us we pray||
 Let there be light
 Open our eyes to Your heart
 Desperate just to know who You are
 Shine in us we pray
 Jesus have Your way

[V2]
 There’s no borders in Your love
 No division in Your heart
 God of heaven
 God of freedom

 There’s no taking back the cross
 No regret in what it cost
 God of freedom
 God of heaven

[B]
 Good news embracing the poor
 Comfort for all those who mourn
 For the broken hearted
 We sing louder

 Release from prison and shame
 Oppression turning to praise
 For every captive
 Sing louder||

 Restoring sight to the blind
 Breaking the curse of the night
 For all in darkness
 Sing louder

 Proclaiming freedom for all
 This is the day of the Lord
 Beauty for ashes

[V3]
.C F G F

 Let the light that shines above
 Become the light that shines in us
 There’s no darkness in Your way
 So have Your way
 Lord have Your way</lyrics>
