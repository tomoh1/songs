  <lyrics>[V1]
.A
 My hope is built on nothing less
.     D                E
 Than Jesus blood and righteousness
.F#m                    E
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
.D            E             A
 But wholly trust in Jesus name

[C]
.         D            E
 Christ alone, cornerstone
.A/C#         D           E
 Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
.A/C#          D           E
 Through the storm, He is Lord
.        A
 Lord of all

[V2]
 When Darkness seems to hide His face
 I rest on His unchanging grace
 In every high and stormy gale
 My anchor holds within the veil
 My anchor holds within the veil

[B]
.      F#m           D
 He is Lord, Lord of all

[V3]
 When He shall come with trumpet sound,
 Oh, may I then in Him be found;
 Dressed in His righteousness alone,
 Faultless stand before the throne.
