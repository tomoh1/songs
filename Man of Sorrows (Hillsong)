  <lyrics>[V1]
.D               G       D
 Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
.G      D       A
 By His own betrayed
.    Bm             G        Bm
 The sin of man and wrath of God
.    G       A    D
 Has been on Jesus laid

[V2]
 Silent as He stood accused
 Beaten, mocked and scorned
 Bowing to the Father's will
 He took a crown of thorns

[C]
.         Bm     G            D A
 Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation
.           Bm          G       A
 Where your love poured out over me
.       Bm         D        A Bm
 Now my soul cries out hallelujah
.           G     A   D
 Praise and honor unto Thee

[V3]
 Sent of heaven, God's own Son
 To purchase and redeem
 And reconcile the very ones
 Who nailed Him to that tree
---
[B]
.       Bm      G
 Now my debt is paid
.      D       A
 It is paid in full
.       Bm       G
 By the precious blood
.        D     A
 That my Jesus spilled ||
.        Bm       G
 Now the curse of sin
.       D       A
 Has no hold on me
.         Bm       G
 Whom the Son sets free
.      D    A
 Oh is free indeed

[V4]
 See the stone is rolled away
 Behold the empty tomb
 Hallelujah, God be praised
 He's risen from the grave</lyrics>
