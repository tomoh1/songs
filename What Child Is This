[V1]
.       Em       G        D       Bm
 What Child is this who, laid to rest
.     C        Am     B
 On Mary’s lap is sleeping?
.      Em      G         D        Bm
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
.        C        B          Em    Bm
 While shepherds watch are keeping?

[C1]
.G                D        Bm
 This, this is Christ the King,
.       C        Am       B
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
. G                 D         Bm
 Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
.     C         B      Em
 The Babe, the Son of Mary.

[V2]
Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

[C2]
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

.Em D C Am
[B]
.Em        D C Am
 Hallelujah

[V3]
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come peasant, king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

[C3]
Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.</lyrics></song>
