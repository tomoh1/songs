.          C#m                  A
 There's a peace I've come to know
.           E                   B
 Though my heart and flesh may fail
.           C#m            A
 There's an anchor for my soul
.       E           B
 I can say, "It is well"

[P]
.E              B/D#
 Jesus has overcome
.          C#m          A
 And the grave is overwhelmed
.E/G#           B/D#
 The victory is won
.       C#m            A
 He is risen from the dead

[C]
.            E            B
 And I will rise when He calls my name
.C#m              A
 No more sorrow, no more pain
.        E               B
 I will rise on eagles' wings
.   C#m             A
 Before my God fall on my knees
.    E/G# A
 And rise
.       E/B B
 I will rise

[V2]
 There's a day that's drawing near
 When this darkness breaks to light
 And the shadows disappear
 And my faith shall be my eyes

[B]
.                A        E           B
 And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
. A     E       B
 Worthy is the Lamb
.                A       E    B        (F#m)
 And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
. A     E       B
 Worthy is the Lamb</lyrics>
