  <lyrics>[V1]
.    A
 The splendor of the King
.F#m
 Clothed in majesty
.                     D
 Let all the earth rejoice
.
 All the earth rejoice ||

 He wraps Himself in light
 And darkness tries to hide
 And trembles at his voice
 Trembles at His voice

[C]
.     A
 How great is our God
.                  F#m
 Sing with me how great is our God
.                   D         E
 All will see how great, how great
.       A
 Is our God

[V2]
 Age to age He stands
 Time is in His hands
 Beginning and the end
 Beginning and the end ||

 The God head three in one
 Father, Spirit, Son
 Lion and the Lamb
 Lion and the Lamb

[B]
 Name above all names
 Worthy of all praise
 My heart will sing
 How great is our God</lyrics>
