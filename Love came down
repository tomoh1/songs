.      Cmaj7                       Em                D
 If my heart is overwhelmed and I cannot hear Your voice 
.          Cmaj7                        G          D/F# 
 I'll hold on to what is true though I cannot see 
.        Cmaj7                            Em               D
 If the storms of life they come and the road ahead gets steep 
.       Cmaj7                        G            D/F# 
 I will lift these hands in faith I will believe

 And the life I have because Your Son

 Love came down and rescued me
.Cmaj7
 Love came down and set me free 
.Em         D             C
 I am Yours I am forever Yours
.G
 Mountain high or valley low 
.Cmaj7
 I sing out remind my soul
.Em         D       C
 I am Yours I am forever Yours

[V2]
 When my heart is filled with hope and every promise comes my way
 When I feel Your hands of grace rest upon me
 Staying desperate for You God, staying humbled at Your feet
 I will lift these hands and praise I will believe

[B]
.     G/B         Cmaj7          Em   D       C
 I am Yours, I am Yours, all my days, I am forever Yours</lyrics>
