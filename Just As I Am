  <lyrics>[Intro]
.G Gsus G Gsus

[V1]
.     G   D/G     C/G       G
 Just as I am without one plea
.      D        C                 G
 But that Thy blood was shed for me
.      G       D/F#    Em       C
 And that Thou bid me come to Thee
.  G/B      C     D      G
 O Lamb of God I come I come

[V2]
.     G    D/G     C/G     G
 Just as I am and waiting not
.    D      C                 G
 To rid my soul of one dark blot
.    G          D/F#        Em          C
 To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
.  G/B      C     D      G    D/F#
 O Lamb of God I come I come

[C]
.         Em          C
 I come broken to be mended
.         G            D
 I come wounded to be healed
.         Em             C
 I come desperate to be rescued
.       G            D
 I come empty to be filled
.        Em            C
 I come guilty to be pardoned
.        G/B                 C
 By the blood of Christ the Lamb
.         C      D     Em                C
 And I'm welcomed with open arms praise God
.     D    G
 Just as I am

[V3]
.     G    D/G   C/G      G
 Just as I am I would be lost
.     D          C               G
 But mercy and grace my freedom bought
.     G     D/F#  Em        C
 And now to glory in Your cross
.  G/B      C     D      G    D/F#
 O Lamb of God I come I come</lyrics>
